    "This project aims to solve the problem of automatically classifying musical chords as either major or minor using audio input. Chord identification is a key task in music analysis, and automating it can save time on transcription and harmonic analysis. By using machine learning and music information retrieval (MIR) techniques, the goal is to create a tool that helps musicians, producers, and educators analyze music in real-time. The project focuses on making chord recognition more accessible and efficient, benefiting both students and professionals in the music industry."

    "The dataset used in this project is sourced from the [Musical Instrument Chord Classification (Audio)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/deepcontractor/musical-instrument-chord-classification) dataset on Kaggle. It contains audio files `.wav` format of chords played on two instruments: guitar and piano. The raw data has been scraped from various sources and is already available for download on Kaggle, eliminating the need for manual data collection. The dataset is well-suited for this project, as it provides a clear distinction between major and minor chords, which is the focus of the classification task.\n",

Preprocessing will involve extracting features like MFCCs, spectrograms, or chroma features to transform the audio into usable data. Challenges include ensuring that these features correctly capture the harmonic information while handling variations in recording quality and instrument type. We estimate several hundred rows of data, each representing an individual chord sample. Visualizations like waveform plots and spectrograms will be used to explore the features that distinguish major from minor chords."
