    "This project aims to solve the problem of automatically classifying musical chords as either major or minor using audio input. Chord identification is a key task in music analysis, and automating it can save time on transcription and harmonic analysis. By using machine learning and music information retrieval (MIR) techniques, the goal is to create a tool that helps musicians, producers, and educators analyze music in real-time. The project focuses on making chord recognition more accessible and efficient, benefiting both students and professionals in the music industry."

It contains audio files `.wav` format of chords played on two instruments: guitar and piano. The raw data has been scraped from various sources and is already available for download on Kaggle, eliminating the need for manual data collection.
